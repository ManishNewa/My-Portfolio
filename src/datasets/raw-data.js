      'International-Mind Wellbeing is a specialized web application designed to support the mental health of Nepalese international students. The platform provides accessible assessment tools and resources to help students navigate the unique challenges of studying abroad. The application features two primary user roles: Administrators and International Students. Administrators have access to a centralized dashboard for tracking mental health trends, analyzing survey data, and managing assessment forms. Meanwhile, international students can complete mental health assessments anonymously or register to track their progress over time. Prioritizing usability and accessibility, this project aims to create a meaningful impact by empowering students to monitor their well-being and make informed decisions about their mental health, ultimately enhancing their academic and personal growth.',
